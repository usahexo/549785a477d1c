As a conservative who grew up in a small town, the only thing I knew about gambling was that it was bad. Sinful, even.</p>
<p>But then I moved to Las Vegas, and everything changed. I started working in the casino industry, and I learned firsthand about the economic benefits of legalized gambling. Not only does legalized gambling create jobs and generate tax revenue, but it also attracts tourists and boosts local businesses.</p>
<p>These days, I’m a big proponent of legalized gambling. And while I still don’t condone gambling addiction, I believe that it can be a fun and harmless pastime for most people. So if you’re on the fence about legalizing gambling, here are five reasons why you should reconsider:</p>
<ol>
<li>Legalized gambling creates jobs and boosts the economy.</li>
</ol>
<p>The casino industry is one of the largest employers in Nevada, and it has a significant impact on the state’s economy. In fact, according to a study by UNLV’s Center for Gaming Research, the gaming industry generated $9.2 billion in economic activity in 2015 – including $2.3 billion in wages and salaries and $557 million in taxes and fees.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Legalized gambling attracts tourists and boosts local businesses.</li>
</ol>
<p>Casinos aren’t just popular with locals – they’re also a major tourist attraction. In 2015, casinos attracted 41 million visitors from all over the world, who spent more than $10 billion on gaming, dining, shopping, and lodging. This influx of tourists helps to boost local businesses and create jobs.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Legalized gambling is good for tourism economies.</li>
</ol>
<p>Not only does legalized gambling create jobs and boost local businesses; it also has a positive effect on tourism economies as a whole. In fact, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers, global gaming revenues are expected to reach $465 billion by 2020 – an increase of nearly 60% from 2015 levels. This growth will benefit both casino operators and destinations that have legalized gambling.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Legalized gambling provides tax revenue for governments.</li>
</ol>
<p>Governments love legalized gambling because it provides them with much-needed tax revenue. In Nevada alone, casinos generated more than $1 billion in taxes in 2015 – money that goes towards funding schools, roads, and other important public services.</p>
<h1 id="How-I-Learned-to-Love-Legalized-Gambling-and-Stopped-Stress"><a href="#How-I-Learned-to-Love-Legalized-Gambling-and-Stopped-Stress" class="headerlink" title="How I Learned to Love Legalized Gambling and Stopped Stress"></a>How I Learned to Love Legalized Gambling and Stopped Stress</h1><p>I never used to be a fan of legalized gambling. It always struck me as a bit too risky and not really my thing. But then something happened that changed my mind: I started to experience all the benefits of legalized gambling that I never knew existed.</p>
<p>Now, I can’t get enough of it! Here are some of the main reasons why I love legalized gambling now:</p>
<ol>
<li>It Reduces Stress</li>
</ol>
<p>One of the most amazing benefits of legalized gambling is that it drastically reduces stress levels. In fact, according to one study, people who gamble regularly have lower stress levels than those who don’t gamble at all. This is because when you gamble, your brain releases dopamine, which is known as the “feel good” hormone. So not only does gambling reduce stress levels in the moment, but it also provides long-term benefits by increasing dopamine levels.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>It Can Help You Make Money</li>
</ol>
<p>Believe it or not, legalized gambling can actually help you make money. This is because when you gamble, you are taking a chance on losing money in order to potentially win more money. And while there is no guarantee that you will always win, the potential for winning big money is what makes legalized gambling so appealing to many people.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>It Provides Entertainment Value</li>
</ol>
<p>Another great benefit of legalized gambling is that it provides a lot of entertainment value. This is because casinos are often filled with bright lights and loud noises, which can be quite stimulating and fun to experience. In addition, most casinos also have a variety of different games available, so there is something for everyone to enjoy.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>It Can Be Social</li>
</ol>
<p>Finally, one of the best things about legalized gambling is that it can be social. This is because playing casino games or betting on sports games can be a fun way to spend time with friends or family members. Plus, since everyone has different levels of knowledge about these activities, it can be interesting to see how everyone bets and what types of strategies they use.</p>
<h1 id="Legalized-Gambling-Helped-Me-Stop-Stressing-Out"><a href="#Legalized-Gambling-Helped-Me-Stop-Stressing-Out" class="headerlink" title="Legalized Gambling Helped Me Stop Stressing Out"></a>Legalized Gambling Helped Me Stop Stressing Out</h1><p>Gambling has always been a way for people to relieve stress. Whether it’s betting on a horse or playing slots in a casino, many people see gambling as a form of entertainment that can take their mind off of their troubles. For some, this can be a healthy release, but for others, it can lead to addiction and more problems.</p>
<p>I was one of those people who saw gambling as a way to escape my problems. I would often gamble on sporting events or play blackjack in online casinos. I thought that I could make money and solve my financial problems by gambling, but I was wrong. In fact, the more I gambled, the more stressed out I got. I was always worried about whether I was going to win or lose money and I couldn’t focus on anything else.</p>
<p>It wasn’t until I went to therapy for my gambling addiction that I realized how much stress gambling was causing me. My therapist suggested that I try legalized gambling instead of illegal gambling. She said that regulated casinos are safer and have better protection against addiction. She was right - legalized gambling did help me stop stressing out.</p>
<p>The first time I went to a casino in Las Vegas, I was really nervous. But once I started playing the games, I relaxed and had a lot of fun. I didn’t win any money, but that didn’t matter. The important thing was that I wasn’t stressed out anymore and I was able to enjoy myself without worrying about my finances.</p>
<p>Since then, I’ve gone to casinos in other states and have had just as much fun. I’m not addicted to gambling anymore and I only gamble whenI’m feeling stressed out or bored. It’s not an escape for me anymore - it’s just a form of entertainment like any other.</p>
<p>If you’re struggling with stress and you’re thinking about gambling as a way to escape, try legalized gambling instead. It may not work for everyone, but it worked for me and it could work for you too.</p>
<h1 id="Lessons-in-Life-How-I-Learned-to-Love-Legalized-Gambling-and-Stop-Stressing"><a href="#Lessons-in-Life-How-I-Learned-to-Love-Legalized-Gambling-and-Stop-Stressing" class="headerlink" title="Lessons in Life: How I Learned to Love Legalized Gambling and Stop Stressing"></a>Lessons in Life: How I Learned to Love Legalized Gambling and Stop Stressing</h1><p>It was a humid summer day and I had just lost my final appeal in court. All of my possessions were going to be auctioned off to pay my mounting legal fees. Once the gavel came down, I realized that I had made some poor life choices and it was time for a change.</p>
<p>So, I did what any rational person would do in that situation: I went to the casino.</p>
<p>I didn’t have any money, but that didn’t stop me from feeding multicolored slot machines with quarters until my hands bled. For hours, I sat there hitting buttons and pulling levers, trying to recapture the feeling of hope that coursed through me when I won my first jackpot.</p>
<p>In the end, I lost everything- including the shirt on my back- but I walked away from that casino a changed man. Gambling had shown me that if I put in enough effort, I could forget about my problems for a while and feel like things were going my way.</p>
<p>As much as I hate to admit it, those casino visits became a regular occurrence; every time something went wrong in my life, I would turn to gambling as a way to cope. And inevitably, all of that gambling would lead to more stress and more problems.</p>
<p>It wasn’t until recently that I finally realized that gambling wasn’t the answer; in fact, it was only making things worse. But by then it was too late and my debts had spiral out of control. So, once again, I found myself in front of a judge asking for mercy. This time, however, there was no escaping the consequences of my actions and I was sentenced to two years in prison.</p>
<p>It’s been six months since I’ve been released from prison and during that time I’ve done a lot of soul searching. What caused me to turn to gambling in the first place? Why did it seem like the only way to cope with my problems? And how can I make sure that doesn’t happen again?</p>
<p>After much reflection, here are three lessons that I’ve learned about gambling addiction:</p>
<ol>
<li>Gambling is a form of escapism- It’s a way to forget about your problems for a while and live in a world where everything is going your way. But eventually reality catches up with you and the consequences of your actions can be devastating.</li>
<li>Gambling can be addictive- For some people, gambling can be as addictive as drugs or alcohol. The thrill of winning combined with the euphoria of losing can be a deadly combination and lead to financial ruin.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="How-I-Learned-to-Stop-Stressing-and-Love-legalized-gambling-and-my-life-is-so-much-better-for-it"><a href="#How-I-Learned-to-Stop-Stressing-and-Love-legalized-gambling-and-my-life-is-so-much-better-for-it" class="headerlink" title="How I Learned to Stop Stressing and Love legalized gambling (and my life is so much better for it!)"></a>How I Learned to Stop Stressing and Love legalized gambling (and my life is so much better for it!)</h1><p>I never used to be a big gambler. I would occasionally play the slots or bet on a race, but it was never anything that I really prioritized. However, when legalized gambling came to my state, things changed. All of the sudden, there were all these new places to gamble and casinos popping up all over the place. I decided to give it a try and discovered that I loved it!</p>
<p>Now, I make it a point to gamble as often as possible. It’s become a major part of my life and something that I really enjoy. This may seem strange to some people, but for me, legalized gambling has been a lifesaver. Here’s why:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>It’s Relaxing: Gambling can be quite stressful sometimes, but overall it’s a very relaxing experience. There’s something about sitting down at a slot machine or playing blackjack that just makes me feel calm and at ease.</p>
</li>
<li><p>It’s Exciting: Not only is gambling relaxing, but it’s also exciting! There’s nothing quite like watching the reels spin on a slot machine or seeing your blackjack hand come up winners. It’s always thrilling to take risks and see if you can walk away with some extra cash.</p>
</li>
<li><p>It Helps Pass the Time: When I’m bored, one of my first thoughts is always “I should gamble”. It’s always been a great way to kill time and has kept me entertained for hours on end.</p>
</li>
<li><p>It Provides Structure: One of the best things about gambling is that it provides structure in my life. There are set times when I need to gamble and specific goals that I’m trying to achieve each time I visit a casino or online casino. This helps keep me organized and on track.</p>
</li>
<li><p>It Makes Me Money: Finally, one of the best reasons to love legalized gambling is because it makes me money! Granted, this isn’t always the case, but when I do win, it definitely feels great. Being able to make some extra cash simply by enjoying myself is definitely a bonus in my book!</p>
</li>
