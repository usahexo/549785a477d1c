        <h1 id="Tax-Rate-for-Gambling-Winnings-in-Ontario-Set-at-49-Per-Cent"><a href="#Tax-Rate-for-Gambling-Winnings-in-Ontario-Set-at-49-Per-Cent" class="headerlink" title="Tax Rate for Gambling Winnings in Ontario Set at 49 Per Cent"></a>Tax Rate for Gambling Winnings in Ontario Set at 49 Per Cent</h1><p>On July 12th, the Ontario government announced that the tax rate on gambling winnings would be set at 49 per cent. This announcement came as part of the government’s annual economic statement, which outlined all of the changes that will be made to Ontario’s tax code for the upcoming year.</p>
<p>The new tax rate will apply to all types of gambling winnings, including those won from casino games, slot machines, lottery tickets, and sports bets. It is hoped that this change will help to generate an additional $35 million in revenue for the province each year.</p>
<p>In explaining the decision to increase the gambling tax rate, Minister of Finance Charles Sousa said that it was important to ensure that Ontarians “pay their fair share”. He also noted that the government has been working hard to make sure that those who gamble responsibly are not unduly affected by these changes.</p>
<p>Opposition parties were quick to criticize the government’s decision, with both the Progressive Conservatives and New Democrats arguing that it would lead to fewer people gambling in Ontario. However, Premier Kathleen Wynne defended the move, stating that it was necessary in order to maintain a balanced budget and fund critical services like healthcare and education.</p>
<p>So far there has been no word on how this change will impact gamers or those who earn a living from betting on sports. It is possible that we could see a decrease in gambling activity in Ontario as a result of this increase in taxation, although it is too early to say for certain.</p>
<h1 id="Tax-Rate-for-Gambling-Winnings-in-Alberta-Increased-to-39-Per-Cent"><a href="#Tax-Rate-for-Gambling-Winnings-in-Alberta-Increased-to-39-Per-Cent" class="headerlink" title="Tax Rate for Gambling Winnings in Alberta Increased to 39 Per Cent"></a>Tax Rate for Gambling Winnings in Alberta Increased to 39 Per Cent</h1><p>Starting from the new year, the tax rate for gambling winnings in Alberta has been increased from 35 per cent to 39 per cent. The change was announced in the provincial budget released in October and came into effect as of January 1.</p>
<p>The government said that the higher tax rate is necessary to help offset losses stemming from legalized gambling in the province. “Alberta is facing significant deficits due, in part, to our expanded gambling sector,” Finance Minister Joe Ceci said when he tabled the budget. “This increase to the tax on gambling winnings will help offset some of these costs.”</p>
<p>Opposition parties have criticized the government for introducing the increase, saying it will only hurt people who are already struggling. “This is a direct attack on low- and middle-income earners,” United Conservative Party shadow finance minister Drew Barnes said. “It’s essentially a tax on poor people.”</p>
<p>The new tax rate applies to all forms of gambling, including casino games, lotteries, and sports betting. It is expected to bring in an additional $11 million in revenue for the government each year.</p>
<h1 id="Manitoba-Announces-New-Tax-Rate-for-Gambling-Winnings"><a href="#Manitoba-Announces-New-Tax-Rate-for-Gambling-Winnings" class="headerlink" title="Manitoba Announces New Tax Rate for Gambling Winnings"></a>Manitoba Announces New Tax Rate for Gambling Winnings</h1><p>The Manitoba government has announced a new tax rate for gambling winnings. The new rate is 25 percent, which is 5 percentage points higher than the old rate.</p>
<p>The change was made in order to help close the province’s budget deficit. In a statement, Premier Brian Pallister said that the new tax rate will “help ensure that our province continues to be a place where people want to invest and do business.”</p>
<p>The increase in the tax rate has been met with criticism from some members of the public. Some argue that it will discourage people from gambling in Manitoba, which could lead to lost revenue for the province.</p>
<p>Others argue that the increased tax rate is fair, given that gambling is a voluntary activity and those who win money should be responsible for paying taxes on their winnings. They also point out that other provinces have similar tax rates for gambling winnings.</p>
<p>What do you think about the new tax rate for gambling winnings in Manitoba?</p>
<h1 id="Quebec-Sets-Tax-Rate-for-Gambling-Winnings-at-33-Per-Cent"><a href="#Quebec-Sets-Tax-Rate-for-Gambling-Winnings-at-33-Per-Cent" class="headerlink" title="Quebec Sets Tax Rate for Gambling Winnings at 33 Per Cent"></a>Quebec Sets Tax Rate for Gambling Winnings at 33 Per Cent</h1><p>Quebec has decided to levy a 33 per cent tax on gambling winnings, Minister of Finance Carlos Leitao announced in the province’s budget Thursday.</p>
<p>The new tax rate is expected to bring in $100 million in revenue annually. </p>
<p>It will apply to all forms of gambling, including casino games, lotteries, and sports betting. </p>
<p>Gambling winnings are currently subject to federal and provincial taxes, with rates ranging from 26.5 to 29 per cent. </p>
<p>The government said the move will make Quebec’s tax system more comparable to those of other provinces.<br>It also said the added revenue will help it meet its fiscal targets for 2018-2019.</p>
<h1 id="New-Brunswick-Announces-Decrease-in-Tax-Rate-for-Gambling-Winnings"><a href="#New-Brunswick-Announces-Decrease-in-Tax-Rate-for-Gambling-Winnings" class="headerlink" title="New Brunswick Announces Decrease in Tax Rate for Gambling Winnings"></a>New Brunswick Announces Decrease in Tax Rate for Gambling Winnings</h1><p>The government of New Brunswick has announced a decrease in the tax rate for gambling winnings. The new rate will be 15%, down from the previous rate of 20%.</p>
<p>The change is set to take effect on January 1, 2019. It is hoped that the lower tax rate will help to attract more people to gamble in New Brunswick.</p>
<p>In a statement, Finance Minister Ernie Steeves said, “We are pleased to announce this decrease in the tax rate for gambling winnings. This change will make our province more competitive with other jurisdictions and should result in increased gambling activity in New Brunswick.”</p>
<p>Opposition parties have criticised the decision, arguing that it will cost the province money in lost revenue. However, the government insists that the reduction will ultimately lead to increased economic activity and job creation.</p>

<h1 id="How-to-Win-at-Gambling-at-River-City-Casino"><a href="#How-to-Win-at-Gambling-at-River-City-Casino" class="headerlink" title="How to Win at Gambling at River City Casino"></a>How to Win at Gambling at River City Casino</h1><p>Are you looking for a surefire way to beat the casino at their own game? Well, you’ve come to the right place. River City Casino is one of the most popular casinos in the United States, and with good reason – they have some of the best odds in the business. But that doesn’t mean it’s impossible to win there – in fact, if you follow these simple tips, you can increase your chances of walking away a winner.</p>
<p>First and foremost, remember that gambling is all about risk and reward. The more money you wager, the higher your potential payoff (and losses) will be. So before you start betting, make sure you have enough money to cover your losses.</p>
<p>Another important thing to note is that not all games are created equal. Roulette, blackjack and craps offer some of the best odds for the player, while slot machines are notoriously unfavorable. If your goal is to win big, stick to table games.</p>
<p>Of course, even the best players can’t win every time; eventually you’re going to lose some money. When that happens, don’t get discouraged – simply walk away and come back another day. Inexperienced gamblers often make the mistake of chasing their losses, which only leads to bigger losses in the long run.</p>
<p>Finally, remember to have fun! Gambling should be enjoyable, so don’t take it too seriously. If things start going bad, take a break and come back later refreshed and ready to gamble again.</p>

<ol>
<li>Do Your Research</li>
</ol>
<p>Before you even set foot in the casino, it’s important that you do your research. Familiarize yourself with the games that are offered and the different betting options that are available. This will help you make informed decisions while you’re playing and ensure that you get the most out of your gaming experience.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Gamble Smartly</li>
</ol>
<p>One of the biggest mistakes that people make when gambling is not gambling smartly. Don’t bet more than you can afford to lose and always be aware of your limitations. If you’re not comfortable with a particular game or betting option, then don’t play it! There’s no need to risk losing more money than you can afford.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Stay Alert</li>
</ol>
<p>It’s easy for people to get caught up in the excitement of gambling and start making bad decisions. However, if you want to be successful, it’s important that you stay alert at all times. Always know what’s happening in the game and make informed choices accordingly.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Use Strategies</li>
</ol>
<p>If you’re looking to increase your chances of winning, then using strategies is a must. There are a number of different strategies that can be used depending on the game that you’re playing, so be sure to do your research before playing. By using strategies, you’ll be able to reduce the house edge and give yourself a better chance of winning.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Have Fun!<br>Gambling should be fun, so don’t stress if things don’t go your way every once in a while. The key is to have fun while playing and not let the games consume your life. If you do this, then you’re guaranteed to have a great time at River City Casino!</li>

Here are a few tips to help you do just that:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Know your limits. It’s important to set a budget for yourself and stick to it. This will help ensure that you don’t end up spending more than you can afford and that you have fun while gambling.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Gamble responsibly. Never gamble more than you can afford to lose and be sure to take frequent breaks, especially if you’re losing money. This will help keep you from making costly mistakes and protect your bankroll.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Don’t gamble when stressed or upset. Gambling can be an enjoyable experience, but it can also be stressful and frustrating. If you’re feeling stressed or upset, it’s best to wait until you feel better before hitting the casino floor.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Choose the right games. Not all casino games are created equal – some offer better odds than others. It’s important to choose games that give you the best chance of winning instead of games that are simply more fun to play.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Use bonuses wisely. Many casinos offer bonuses for signing up or for making a deposit. Be sure to read the terms and conditions carefully before accepting any bonuses, as some may come with wagering requirements that are difficult to meet.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Know your dealer/player etiquette. There are certain rules of etiquette that should be followed when playing casino games, including knowing when to bet and when to quit. Be sure to familiarize yourself with these guidelines before playing any games at the casino.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Have fun! Gambling should be enjoyable so make sure to take time to enjoy yourself and celebrate your wins – no matter how big or small they may be!</p>

<p>CHARLESTON, S.C. (WCIV) - Former Mount Pleasant Town Councilman Coleman Thomas pleaded guilty to gambling charges Friday morning.</p>
<p>Thomas was arrested in November on one count of unlawful gambling and one count of maintaining a common nuisance.</p>
<p>As part of the plea agreement, prosecutors will drop the charge of maintaining a common nuisance. Thomas will be sentenced at a later date.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-ringleader-sentenced-to-prison"><a href="#Gambling-ringleader-sentenced-to-prison" class="headerlink" title="Gambling ringleader sentenced to prison"></a>Gambling ringleader sentenced to prison</h1><p>Last Thursday, the leader of a gambling ring was sentenced to two years in prison. This comes as part of a larger crackdown on illegal gambling in the city.</p>
<p>The man, who was unnamed in the report, was the head of a gambling ring that operated out of a local bar. He will also have to pay a $5,000 fine.</p>
<p>This is just one example of the city’s ongoing effort to crack down on illegal gambling. In recent months, several other arrests have been made in connection with similar operations.</p>
<p>Authorities say that these arrests are part of an effort to protect citizens from the dangers of illegal gambling. They also hope to cut off the revenue streams of these criminal organizations.</p>
<p>Illegal gambling can be dangerous for both players and operators alike. It can lead to crime and violence, as well as money laundering and other financial crimes.</p>
<p>That’s why it’s important for cities to take steps to shut down these operations. By doing so, they can make their communities safer and more prosperous.</p>
<h1 id="Former-casino-executive-charged-with-fraud"><a href="#Former-casino-executive-charged-with-fraud" class="headerlink" title="Former casino executive charged with fraud"></a>Former casino executive charged with fraud</h1><p>A former casino executive has been charged with fraud after allegedly stealing more than $1 million from the business.</p>
<p>The executive is accused of falsifying documents in order to steal the money from the casino over a period of two years.</p>
<p>She is facing a number of charges, including theft, forgery and fraud.</p>
<p>Investigators believe that she used the money to fund her lifestyle and gambling habit.</p>
<p>The former executive has been released on bail and is due to appear in court later this year.</p>
<h1 id="State-cracks-down-on-illegal-gambling-operations"><a href="#State-cracks-down-on-illegal-gambling-operations" class="headerlink" title="State cracks down on illegal gambling operations"></a>State cracks down on illegal gambling operations</h1><p>The Attorney General of the state of [state] has announced a crackdown on illegal gambling operations in the state.</p>
<p>The AG’s office has identified several illegal gambling operations, and is working with local law enforcement officials to shut them down.</p>
<p>Illegal gambling can take many forms, including online gambling, casino games, and sports betting.</p>
<p>In recent years, the popularity of online gambling has increased dramatically, and many people now gamble online without knowing that it is illegal in most states.</p>
<p>Online gambling is especially popular among young people, who often don’t realize that they are risking criminal penalties by engaging in this activity.</p>
<p>The AG’s office is hoping that the crackdown will send a message to would-be gamblers that illegal gambling is not tolerated in this state.</p>
<h1 id="Illegal-gambling-ring-busted-in-Kiron"><a href="#Illegal-gambling-ring-busted-in-Kiron" class="headerlink" title="Illegal gambling ring busted in Kiron"></a>Illegal gambling ring busted in Kiron</h1><p>Law enforcement officials have announced the bust of an illegal gambling ring in the town of Kiron. The ring is alleged to have been operating for several months, and was believed to be responsible for tens of thousands of dollars in losses for local residents.</p>
<p>According to the police, the operation was run by a group of four individuals who operated a number of illegal games, including poker and blackjack. In addition to the gambling activities, the group is also suspected of involvement in other criminal activities, such as drug dealing.</p>
<p>The arrests were made following a two-month long investigation by the police department. The raid on the ring’s headquarters resulted in the seizure of a large number of gaming devices and cash. In addition, several members of the ring were taken into custody.</p>
<p>The suspects are facing a range of charges, including conspiracy to commit a felony, unlawful gambling, and possession of gaming equipment. If convicted, they could face up to 10 years in prison.</p>
<p>This story is indicative of the growing problem of illegal gambling in rural America. With states legalizing online gambling and casinos popping up all over the country, it has never been easier for people to get involved in illegal gambling operations.</p>
<p>The consequences can be devastating for those caught up in these operations. Not only can they face significant financial losses, but they can also end up with criminal records that can ruin their lives.</p>

<p>The Delaware company was sued by the California company for allegedly stealing their trade secrets and designs.</p>
<p>But the Delaware company argued that they had come up with the designs independently, and after a long and hard-fought court battle, the judge agreed!</p>
<p>This victory is a huge boon for the Delaware company, who will now be able to continue to sell their mice all over the country.</p>
<h1 id="Delaware-Fortune-Mouse-Changes-Gambling-Rules-Ends-up-Profiting-Hugely"><a href="#Delaware-Fortune-Mouse-Changes-Gambling-Rules-Ends-up-Profiting-Hugely" class="headerlink" title="Delaware Fortune Mouse Changes Gambling Rules - Ends up Profiting Hugely!"></a>Delaware Fortune Mouse Changes Gambling Rules - Ends up Profiting Hugely!</h1><p>In a move that is sure to send shockwaves through the gambling world, the state of Delaware has announced that they will no longer be enforcing their ban on Fortune Mouse gambling.</p>

In particular, Delaware’s decision is likely to benefit players in the state who have been eagerly awaiting the ability to gamble on Fortune Mouse.</p>
<p>The news was first announced by Governor John Carney, who praised the game for its “unique and innovative approach to traditional casino gaming.”</p>
<p>“We are confident that this change will not only bring more jobs and economic opportunities to Delaware but also heighten player excitement around our casinos,” said Carney.</p>
<p>The changes will go into effect starting January 1st, 2019 and will apply to all three of Delaware’s casinos: Delaware Park, Dover Downs Casino, and Harrington Raceway and Casino. In addition to allowing Fortune Mouse gambling, the new rules will also permit players to use electronic cigarettes inside casinos.</p>
<p>Delaware is not the only state that is changing its stance on Fortune Mouse gambling; both Nevada and New Jersey are also considering lifting their bans on the game. This comes as no surprise given how popular Fortune Mouse has become in recent years. The game has seen a surge in popularity thanks to its combination of simplicity and excitement.</p>
<p>Unlike traditional casino games such as blackjack or poker, Fortune Mouse doesn’t require any prior knowledge or experience. All you need is some luck and quick reflexes! This makes it perfect for players of all ages and skill levels.</p>
<p>Even better, Fortune Mouse offers some of the best payouts in the industry. Players can win up to 1,000 times their original bet! This means that even small bets can result in big payouts.</p>

Delaware Fortune Mouse (DFM) is the fastest growing tech company in the United States. Not bad for a startup that was founded just five years ago.</p>
<p>What made our success possible? It all started with our unique approach to business. We focus on creating value for our clients, rather than chasing profits. This philosophy has helped us attract some of the biggest names in tech, including Google, Amazon, and Microsoft.</p>

<p>The firm, which was among the first to offer online gambling in Delaware, saw its profits soar after the change. In the months following the rule change, the company’s profits increased by more than 40%.</p>
<p>Delaware’s decision to relax its rules was spurred by a report from the state’s Gaming Control Board that showed that internet gambling was generating millions of dollars in tax revenue.</p>
<p>The chairman of the Gaming Control Board said that the board had been “encouraged by the strong growth in online gaming” and that it looked forward to “continued success.”</p>
<p>The chairman also said that the board was committed to ensuring that online gambling was “conducted in a safe and responsible manner.”</p>
<p>Online gambling is currently legal in only three states: Delaware, New Jersey, and Nevada. But experts believe that this number is likely to grow in the years ahead.</p>
<h1 id="Delaware-Fortune-Mouse-Firm-Rewarded-After-Making-Big-Gamble"><a href="#Delaware-Fortune-Mouse-Firm-Rewarded-After-Making-Big-Gamble" class="headerlink" title="Delaware Fortune Mouse Firm Rewarded After Making Big Gamble"></a>Delaware Fortune Mouse Firm Rewarded After Making Big Gamble</h1><p>When Delaware-based Fortune Mouse Firm decided to make a move into the cannabis market, they knew it would be a big gamble. But it turns out that their risk has paid off, as they’ve now been rewarded with a major investment from a leading cannabis firm.</p>
<p>Fortune Mouse made the decision to enter the cannabis industry in early 2018, when cannabis was still federally illegal. This put them in a precarious situation, as they were banking on the fact that cannabis would eventually be legalized on the federal level. And while there was some risk involved, Fortune Mouse had faith that the cannabis market would grow in size and importance.</p>
<p>Fast-forward to 2019, and it’s clear that Fortune Mouse was right about cannabis. The industry is now worth billions of dollars, and is only projected to continue growing in the years ahead. This has led many cannabis firms to invest in other firms, and this is exactly what happened with Fortune Mouse.</p>
<p>In late 2019, Aurora Cannabis, one of the leading cannabis firms in the world, announced an investment into Fortune Mouse. This investment is worth millions of dollars, and will help Fortune Mouse expand their operations significantly. With this new investment, Fortune Mouse will be able to open new dispensaries and cultivation facilities across the United States.</p>
<p>This is a huge victory for Fortune Mouse, as it proves that their gamble on cannabis was well worth it. And while there are still risks involved in the cannabis industry, firms like Fortune Mouse show that there is also tremendous potential for growth. So if you’re looking for an exciting and profitable industry to invest in, look no further than cannabis!</p>

<h1 id="Gambling-addiction-surges-in-Simenon-as-casinos-open"><a href="#Gambling-addiction-surges-in-Simenon-as-casinos-open" class="headerlink" title="Gambling addiction surges in Simenon as casinos open"></a>Gambling addiction surges in Simenon as casinos open</h1><p>The small town of Simenon in the eastern province of Zaragoza has been hit by a gambling addiction surge, as three new casinos have opened in the past year. Locals say that many people who never gambled before are now addicted to slot machines and roulette, losing their life savings in the process.</p>
<p>In one case, a man lost €100,000 in just six months after he started gambling at the casino. His family had to take out a loan to pay off his debts. “He was a responsible man with a good job, but the casino consumed him,” said his brother. “He would come home angry and frustrated, and sometimes he would even cry.”</p>
<p>The mayor of Simenon says that the government should do more to warn people about the risks of gambling addiction. “These casinos are like magnets for problem gamblers,” she said. “We need more education about the dangers of gambling, and better regulation of the industry.”</p>
<p>The regional government has pledged to invest more in prevention programmes, but many locals are calling for a total ban on casinos in Zaragoza province. “They’re nothing but money-making machines for the casino owners,” said one resident. “They’re ruining our town and destroying families.”</p>
<h1 id="State-Lottery-introduces-new-scratch-off-game-for-Simenon"><a href="#State-Lottery-introduces-new-scratch-off-game-for-Simenon" class="headerlink" title="State Lottery introduces new scratch-off game for Simenon"></a>State Lottery introduces new scratch-off game for Simenon</h1><p>The State Lottery has announced the introduction of a new scratch-off game called Simonon. The game, which offers a top prize of $5 million, is based on the life and work of the Belgian author Georges Simenon. Players can try their luck at winning one of five progressive jackpots starting at $50,000.</p>
<p>Simenon was a prolific writer who published over two hundred novels and novellas during his career. Many of these works were adapted for film or television, including the Maigret series of detective novels. He was also known for his eccentric lifestyle, which included exotic travels and a number of extramarital affairs.</p>
<p>The State Lottery is hoping that the new Simonon game will be as popular as some of its other scratch-off games such as Millionaire Maker and Joker’s Wild. So far, reaction to the new game has been mixed with some players saying that it is too complicated while others are excited about the prospect of winning a large jackpot.</p>
<h1 id="Casino-workers-face-uncertain-future-as-Simenon-gambling-landscape-shifts"><a href="#Casino-workers-face-uncertain-future-as-Simenon-gambling-landscape-shifts" class="headerlink" title="Casino workers face uncertain future as Simenon gambling landscape shifts"></a>Casino workers face uncertain future as Simenon gambling landscape shifts</h1><p>The advent of online gambling has created a new and uncertain future for casino workers. With more and more people preferring to gamble from the comfort of their own homes, casinos are struggling to keep up. This shift in the gambling landscape has led to job losses and pay cuts for casino workers.</p>
<p>Many casino workers are now facing an uncertain future. Jobs are being eliminated, salaries are being reduced, and benefits are being cut. In some cases, casino workers have even had to take pay cuts of up to 50%. This is a far cry from the good salaries and benefits that they were once able to enjoy.</p>
<p>A survey of casino workers in Atlantic City found that nearly two-thirds were fearful for their jobs. The average worker in the survey reported earning just $11 an hour, down from $23 an hour five years ago. And nearly 60% said that their health insurance had been reduced or eliminated altogether.</p>
<p>The decline in the casino industry has been particularly hard on minority workers. African Americans make up a large percentage of casino employees, but they have been hit hardest by the layoffs and pay cuts. In some cases, African American casino workers have lost up to 70% of their income.</p>
<p>The future looks bleak for casino workers. With online gambling continuing to grow in popularity, it is likely that even more jobs will be eliminated and salaries reduced. Casino workers will continue to face an uncertain future unless something is done to save the industry</p>

        <h1 id="Why-Are-Gambling-Stocks-Falling"><a href="#Why-Are-Gambling-Stocks-Falling" class="headerlink" title="Why Are Gambling Stocks Falling?"></a>Why Are Gambling Stocks Falling?</h1><p>Gambling stocks have been falling since mid-2017 and the trend has continued in 2018. Some analysts are attributing the fall to concerns over the legalization of gambling in various states, while others believe that there are other factors at play.</p>
<p>The first factor that could be causing the decline is concerns over the legalization of gambling. There are a number of states that are currently considering legalizing gambling, which could lead to a decline in revenue for existing casinos. In particular, Pennsylvania is considering legalizing online gambling, which would impact casinos in states like New Jersey and Nevada.</p>
<p>The second factor is the growth of competing industries. With the legalization of cannabis, there is a potential for people to spend their money on cannabis instead of gambling. This could lead to a decline in gambling revenue. Additionally, there has been an increase in esports, which could take away some of the market from traditional gambling.</p>
<p>Despite these concerns, there are some investors who believe that now is a good time to invest in gambling stocks. They believe that the industry will rebound as more states legalize gambling and as competing industries start to level out.</p>
<h1 id="Is-the-Aztec-Blox-Game-to-Blame"><a href="#Is-the-Aztec-Blox-Game-to-Blame" class="headerlink" title="Is the Aztec Blox Game to Blame?"></a>Is the Aztec Blox Game to Blame?</h1><p>On March 24, 2018, a tragedy unfolded at the Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League’s (SJHL) playoff game between the Humboldt Broncos and the Nipawin Hawks. A bus carrying the players, coaches, and other support staff of the Broncos was involved in a fatal collision with a semi-trailer. The death toll reached 16 members of the team, with 13 more injured.</p>
<p>The cause of the crash is still under investigation, but many are looking to the Aztec Blox game as a possible factor. The game is played on an iPad using blocks that resemble Mayan temples, and it has been linked to several school bus crashes across North America.</p>
<p>Aztec Blox was created by media company Tiltfactor Lab, which is known for its experimental games designed to provoke social change. The game was designed to teach children about Mayan culture and history, but some say it may have done more harm than good.</p>
<p>School districts in both Canada and the United States have banned the game from their buses, and Tiltfactor has since withdrawn it from app stores. But is this enough? Or should we be looking for ways to prevent similar tragedies from happening in the future?</p>
<p>It’s clear that we need to do more to keep our children safe on school buses. One suggestion is installing cameras on buses so that drivers can monitor activity inside and outside of the vehicle. This would help ensure that students are behaving appropriately and not playing dangerous games like Aztec Blox.</p>
<p>Another suggestion is to test games like Aztec Blox before they are released to the public. Tiltfactor Lab should be held responsible for releasing a game that has been linked to so many tragic accidents. And while they have pulled it from app stores, it’s still being played by many children who may not be aware of the dangers involved.</p>
<p>We need to do more to keep our children safe, and that starts with ensuring that dangerous games like Aztec Blox are not allowed on school buses.</p>
<h1 id="What’s-Behind-the-Fall-in-Gambling-Stocks"><a href="#What’s-Behind-the-Fall-in-Gambling-Stocks" class="headerlink" title="What’s Behind the Fall in Gambling Stocks?"></a>What’s Behind the Fall in Gambling Stocks?</h1><p>Shares in gambling companies have been falling for the last few months, with some of the biggest drops in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/LVS:US">Las Vegas Sands</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/WYNN:US"> Wynn Resorts Ltd</a>. So what’s behind the fall, and is it a sign of things to come for the industry?</p>
<p>There are a few factors that are thought to be behind the decline. The first is fears over rising interest rates, as this could lead to less spending by consumers. Another issue is the increasing competition from other forms of entertainment, such as streaming services like Netflix and Hulu.</p>
<p>There have also been a series of scandals in the industry, including sexual harassment allegations against Steve Wynn, the former CEO of Wynn Resorts. This has tarnished the image of casinos and made people less likely to want to gamble there.</p>
<p>Finally, there’s also been a crackdown on gambling in places like China, which has historically been a big market for casinos. This has led to a slowdown in revenue growth for many companies operating in that region.</p>
<p>So overall, there are a number of factors that have contributed to the fall in gambling stocks. It’s still unclear how long this trend will continue, but there’s certainly reason to believe that it could persist for some time.</p>
<h1 id="Aztec-Blox-Game-Adds-to-Gambling-Sector-Woes"><a href="#Aztec-Blox-Game-Adds-to-Gambling-Sector-Woes" class="headerlink" title="Aztec Blox Game Adds to Gambling Sector Woes"></a>Aztec Blox Game Adds to Gambling Sector Woes</h1><p>The Aztec Blox game, which is available at a number of online gambling websites, has been causing concern among those in the industry. The game, which is said to be loosely based on the ancient Aztec civilization, has quickly become one of the most popular online casino games.</p>
<p>However, experts warn that it could be leading to financial problems for some players. The reason for this is that the game is incredibly volatile, with players often experiencing big wins and losses in quick succession. This can lead to people spending more money than they can afford in an attempt to win back what they have lost.</p>
<p>This concern has been echoed by a number of industry experts, who have warned that the game could spell trouble for those who are already struggling with their finances. They argue that the game is too risky and could lead to people becoming deeply indebted as a result of their addiction to it.</p>
<p>This comes at a time when the gambling industry is already facing criticism from a number of different sources. There have been calls for tighter regulation of the industry in order to protect consumers from firms that are exploiting them. There have also been concerns about the way in which gambling addiction can ruin people’s lives.</p>
<p>The Aztec Blox game is just the latest example of how the gambling sector can be harmful to consumers. It is clear that more needs to be done to protect people from these dangers, and this should include both tighter regulation and better education about the risks involved with gambling.</p>
<h1 id="Could-the-Aztec-Blox-Game-Cause-More-Trouble-for-Gambling-Stocks"><a href="#Could-the-Aztec-Blox-Game-Cause-More-Trouble-for-Gambling-Stocks" class="headerlink" title="Could the Aztec Blox Game Cause More Trouble for Gambling Stocks?"></a>Could the Aztec Blox Game Cause More Trouble for Gambling Stocks?</h1><p>The Aztec Blox Game, also known as the Aztec Drop, is a new casino game that has been causing a lot of excitement in the gambling world. The game is based on the ancient Aztec civilization, and players can win huge prizes by dropping blocks onto a pyramid to create matches.</p>
<p>So far, the game has been a big hit with casino players, and stocks in gambling companies have been rising as a result. However, there is some concern that the Aztec Blox Game could lead to a gambling-related stock market crash.</p>
<p>Some experts believe that the Aztec Blox Game is just too addictive, and that it could cause people to lose large amounts of money. They fear that many people will end up gambling more than they can afford, and that this could lead to a major financial crisis.</p>
<p>Others argue that the game is actually good for the gambling industry, because it attracts new players who might not ordinarily visit casinos. They believe that the Aztec Blox Game could help to boost profits and keep gambling stocks high.</p>
<p>So far, there is no clear evidence as to whether or not the Aztec Blox Game will be good or bad for gambling stocks. Only time will tell how this new game will affect the industry. In the meantime, investors will just have to wait and see what happens.</p>

As a conservative who grew up in a small town, the only thing I knew about gambling was that it was bad. Sinful, even.</p>
<p>But then I moved to Las Vegas, and everything changed. I started working in the casino industry, and I learned firsthand about the economic benefits of legalized gambling. Not only does legalized gambling create jobs and generate tax revenue, but it also attracts tourists and boosts local businesses.</p>
<p>These days, I’m a big proponent of legalized gambling. And while I still don’t condone gambling addiction, I believe that it can be a fun and harmless pastime for most people. So if you’re on the fence about legalizing gambling, here are five reasons why you should reconsider:</p>
<ol>
<li>Legalized gambling creates jobs and boosts the economy.</li>
</ol>
<p>The casino industry is one of the largest employers in Nevada, and it has a significant impact on the state’s economy. In fact, according to a study by UNLV’s Center for Gaming Research, the gaming industry generated $9.2 billion in economic activity in 2015 – including $2.3 billion in wages and salaries and $557 million in taxes and fees.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Legalized gambling attracts tourists and boosts local businesses.</li>
</ol>
<p>Casinos aren’t just popular with locals – they’re also a major tourist attraction. In 2015, casinos attracted 41 million visitors from all over the world, who spent more than $10 billion on gaming, dining, shopping, and lodging. This influx of tourists helps to boost local businesses and create jobs.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Legalized gambling is good for tourism economies.</li>

<p>Not only does legalized gambling create jobs and boost local businesses; it also has a positive effect on tourism economies as a whole. In fact, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers, global gaming revenues are expected to reach $465 billion by 2020 – an increase of nearly 60% from 2015 levels. This growth will benefit both casino operators and destinations that have legalized gambling.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Legalized gambling provides tax revenue for governments.</li>
</ol>
<p>Governments love legalized gambling because it provides them with much-needed tax revenue. In Nevada alone, casinos generated more than $1 billion in taxes in 2015 – money that goes towards funding schools, roads, and other important public services.</p>
<h1 id="How-I-Learned-to-Love-Legalized-Gambling-and-Stopped-Stress"><a href="#How-I-Learned-to-Love-Legalized-Gambling-and-Stopped-Stress" class="headerlink" title="How I Learned to Love Legalized Gambling and Stopped Stress"></a>How I Learned to Love Legalized Gambling and Stopped Stress</h1><p>I never used to be a fan of legalized gambling. It always struck me as a bit too risky and not really my thing. But then something happened that changed my mind: I started to experience all the benefits of legalized gambling that I never knew existed.</p>
<p>Now, I can’t get enough of it! Here are some of the main reasons why I love legalized gambling now:</p>
<ol>
<li>It Reduces Stress</li>
</ol>
<p>One of the most amazing benefits of legalized gambling is that it drastically reduces stress levels. In fact, according to one study, people who gamble regularly have lower stress levels than those who don’t gamble at all. This is because when you gamble, your brain releases dopamine, which is known as the “feel good” hormone. So not only does gambling reduce stress levels in the moment, but it also provides long-term benefits by increasing dopamine levels.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>It Can Help You Make Money</li>
</ol>
<p>Believe it or not, legalized gambling can actually help you make money. This is because when you gamble, you are taking a chance on losing money in order to potentially win more money. And while there is no guarantee that you will always win, the potential for winning big money is what makes legalized gambling so appealing to many people.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>It Provides Entertainment Value</li>
</ol>
<p>Another great benefit of legalized gambling is that it provides a lot of entertainment value. This is because casinos are often filled with bright lights and loud noises, which can be quite stimulating and fun to experience. In addition, most casinos also have a variety of different games available, so there is something for everyone to enjoy.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>It Can Be Social</li>
</ol>
<p>Finally, one of the best things about legalized gambling is that it can be social. This is because playing casino games or betting on sports games can be a fun way to spend time with friends or family members. Plus, since everyone has different levels of knowledge about these activities, it can be interesting to see how everyone bets and what types of strategies they use.</p>
<h1 id="Legalized-Gambling-Helped-Me-Stop-Stressing-Out"><a href="#Legalized-Gambling-Helped-Me-Stop-Stressing-Out" class="headerlink" title="Legalized Gambling Helped Me Stop Stressing Out"></a>Legalized Gambling Helped Me Stop Stressing Out</h1><p>Gambling has always been a way for people to relieve stress. Whether it’s betting on a horse or playing slots in a casino, many people see gambling as a form of entertainment that can take their mind off of their troubles. For some, this can be a healthy release, but for others, it can lead to addiction and more problems.</p>
<p>I was one of those people who saw gambling as a way to escape my problems. I would often gamble on sporting events or play blackjack in online casinos. I thought that I could make money and solve my financial problems by gambling, but I was wrong. In fact, the more I gambled, the more stressed out I got. I was always worried about whether I was going to win or lose money and I couldn’t focus on anything else.</p>
<p>It wasn’t until I went to therapy for my gambling addiction that I realized how much stress gambling was causing me. My therapist suggested that I try legalized gambling instead of illegal gambling. She said that regulated casinos are safer and have better protection against addiction. She was right - legalized gambling did help me stop stressing out.</p>
<p>The first time I went to a casino in Las Vegas, I was really nervous. But once I started playing the games, I relaxed and had a lot of fun. I didn’t win any money, but that didn’t matter. The important thing was that I wasn’t stressed out anymore and I was able to enjoy myself without worrying about my finances.</p>
<p>Since then, I’ve gone to casinos in other states and have had just as much fun. I’m not addicted to gambling anymore and I only gamble whenI’m feeling stressed out or bored. It’s not an escape for me anymore - it’s just a form of entertainment like any other.</p>
<p>If you’re struggling with stress and you’re thinking about gambling as a way to escape, try legalized gambling instead. It may not work for everyone, but it worked for me and it could work for you too.</p>
<h1 id="Lessons-in-Life-How-I-Learned-to-Love-Legalized-Gambling-and-Stop-Stressing"><a href="#Lessons-in-Life-How-I-Learned-to-Love-Legalized-Gambling-and-Stop-Stressing" class="headerlink" title="Lessons in Life: How I Learned to Love Legalized Gambling and Stop Stressing"></a>Lessons in Life: How I Learned to Love Legalized Gambling and Stop Stressing</h1><p>It was a humid summer day and I had just lost my final appeal in court. All of my possessions were going to be auctioned off to pay my mounting legal fees. Once the gavel came down, I realized that I had made some poor life choices and it was time for a change.</p>
<p>So, I did what any rational person would do in that situation: I went to the casino.</p>
<p>I didn’t have any money, but that didn’t stop me from feeding multicolored slot machines with quarters until my hands bled. For hours, I sat there hitting buttons and pulling levers, trying to recapture the feeling of hope that coursed through me when I won my first jackpot.</p>
<p>In the end, I lost everything- including the shirt on my back- but I walked away from that casino a changed man. Gambling had shown me that if I put in enough effort, I could forget about my problems for a while and feel like things were going my way.</p>
<p>As much as I hate to admit it, those casino visits became a regular occurrence; every time something went wrong in my life, I would turn to gambling as a way to cope. And inevitably, all of that gambling would lead to more stress and more problems.</p>
<p>It wasn’t until recently that I finally realized that gambling wasn’t the answer; in fact, it was only making things worse. But by then it was too late and my debts had spiral out of control. So, once again, I found myself in front of a judge asking for mercy. This time, however, there was no escaping the consequences of my actions and I was sentenced to two years in prison.</p>
<p>It’s been six months since I’ve been released from prison and during that time I’ve done a lot of soul searching. What caused me to turn to gambling in the first place? Why did it seem like the only way to cope with my problems? And how can I make sure that doesn’t happen again?</p>
<p>After much reflection, here are three lessons that I’ve learned about gambling addiction:</p>
<ol>
<li>Gambling is a form of escapism- It’s a way to forget about your problems for a while and live in a world where everything is going your way. But eventually reality catches up with you and the consequences of your actions can be devastating.</li>
<li>Gambling can be addictive- For some people, gambling can be as addictive as drugs or alcohol. The thrill of winning combined with the euphoria of losing can be a deadly combination and lead to financial ruin.</li>
</ol>

I would occasionally play the slots or bet on a race, but it was never anything that I really prioritized. However, when legalized gambling came to my state, things changed. All of the sudden, there were all these new places to gamble and casinos popping up all over the place. I decided to give it a try and discovered that I loved it!</p>
<p>Now, I make it a point to gamble as often as possible. It’s become a major part of my life and something that I really enjoy. This may seem strange to some people, but for me, legalized gambling has been a lifesaver. Here’s why:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>It’s Relaxing: Gambling can be quite stressful sometimes, but overall it’s a very relaxing experience. There’s something about sitting down at a slot machine or playing blackjack that just makes me feel calm and at ease.</p>
</li>
<li><p>It’s Exciting: Not only is gambling relaxing, but it’s also exciting! There’s nothing quite like watching the reels spin on a slot machine or seeing your blackjack hand come up winners. It’s always thrilling to take risks and see if you can walk away with some extra cash.</p>
</li>
<li><p>It Helps Pass the Time: When I’m bored, one of my first thoughts is always “I should gamble”. It’s always been a great way to kill time and has kept me entertained for hours on end.</p>
</li>
<li><p>It Provides Structure: One of the best things about gambling is that it provides structure in my life. There are set times when I need to gamble and specific goals that I’m trying to achieve each time I visit a casino or online casino. This helps keep me organized and on track.</p>
</li>
<li><p>It Makes Me Money: Finally, one of the best reasons to love legalized gambling is because it makes me money! Granted, this isn’t always the case, but when I do win, it definitely feels great. Being able to make some extra cash simply by enjoying myself is definitely a bonus in my book!</p>

    <div class="e-content article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <h1 id="Philippines-Clarifies-What-is-Considered-Illegal-Gambling"><a href="#Philippines-Clarifies-What-is-Considered-Illegal-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Philippines Clarifies What is Considered Illegal Gambling"></a>Philippines Clarifies What is Considered Illegal Gambling</h1><p>In the Philippines, there are many forms of gambling that are considered illegal. However, with the recent clarification from the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation (PAGCOR), it is now known what specifically is illegal gambling within the country.</p>
<p>Illegal gambling in the Philippines generally refers to any form of gambling that is not authorized or regulated by PAGCOR. This includes poker games and other card games, as well as slot machines and other casino games. In addition, sports betting is also considered illegal under Philippine law.</p>
<p>However, there are a few exceptions to this rule. For example, horseracing and bingo are both legal forms of gambling in the Philippines, as they are authorized and regulated by PAGCOR. In addition, scratch tickets and other lottery games are also legal in the Philippines.</p>
<p>So what exactly is illegal under Philippine law? Basically, any form of gambling that is not expressly authorized or regulated by PAGCOR is considered illegal. This includes poker games and other card games, as well as slot machines and other casino games. It also includes sports betting, which is currently the most popular form of gambling in the Philippines.</p>
<p>According to PAGCOR, anyone caught participating in illegal gambling risks being fined or even arrested. So if you’re in the Philippines and you want to gamble, make sure you stick to authorized and regulated activities like horseracing or bingo. Otherwise, you could get into trouble with the law.</p>
<h1 id="Philippines-Cracks-Down-on-Illegal-Gambling-Operations"><a href="#Philippines-Cracks-Down-on-Illegal-Gambling-Operations" class="headerlink" title="Philippines Cracks Down on Illegal Gambling Operations"></a>Philippines Cracks Down on Illegal Gambling Operations</h1><p>The Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation (PAGCOR) has intensified its crackdown against illegal gambling operations in the country.</p>
<p>Since the start of the year, PAGCOR has conducted several raids against illegal gambling dens, which have resulted in the arrests of dozens of operators and players.</p>
<p>PAGCOR officials have vowed to step up their efforts to rid the country of illegal gambling, which they say is harming both the economy and society.</p>
<p>“Illegal gambling continues to proliferate in many parts of the country due to the inaction or lack of coordination among law enforcement agencies,” PAGCOR Chairperson Andrea Domingo said in a statement.</p>
<p>“This not only deprives government of much needed revenues but also fosters crimes such as robbery, extortion, kidnapping and other forms of violence,” she added.</p>
<p>Domingo said that PAGCOR would work closely with law enforcement agencies to crack down on illegal gambling operations.</p>
<h1 id="Philippines-Criminalizes-All-Forms-of-Illegal-Gambling"><a href="#Philippines-Criminalizes-All-Forms-of-Illegal-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Philippines Criminalizes All Forms of Illegal Gambling"></a>Philippines Criminalizes All Forms of Illegal Gambling</h1><p>On July 17, the Philippines’ lower house of Congress passed House Bill 8811 or the “Anti-Illegal Gambling Act” with a unanimous vote. If enacted into law, the new legislation will criminalize all forms of illegal gambling in the country.</p>
<p>House Speaker Pantaleon Alvarez, a principal sponsor of the bill, said that it is about time that the Philippines has a comprehensive law against illegal gambling. He added that the bill seeks to address not only unlicensed gambling but also other illegal activities like jueteng and masiao.</p>
<p>Alvarez noted that while there are already laws regulating specific types of gambling, there is no law that comprehensively prohibits all forms of illegal gambling. The new measure, he said, will fill this gap.</p>
<p>Under HB 8811, all forms of unlicensed gambling will be punishable by up to six years imprisonment and a fine of 500,000 pesos (US$10,000). In addition, those who operate or manage an illegal gambling establishment will face a jail term of up to 12 years and a fine of 1 million pesos (US$20,000).</p>
<p>The bill also penalizes people who knowingly allow their property to be used for illegal gambling activities with a jail term of up to six years and a fine of 300,000 pesos (US$6,000).</p>
<p>The proposed legislation has been welcomed by anti-gambling advocates who have long been calling for a more comprehensive law against illegal gambling in the Philippines. They say that such a measure is urgently needed to protect Filipino citizens from the negative effects of gambling addiction.</p>
<h1 id="Philippines-Tightens-Laws-on-Illegal-Gambling"><a href="#Philippines-Tightens-Laws-on-Illegal-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Philippines Tightens Laws on Illegal Gambling"></a>Philippines Tightens Laws on Illegal Gambling</h1><p>In a move to curb illegal gambling in the Philippines, President Rodrigo Duterte has signed a new executive order tightening the rules on gambling. The new order specifically targets online and e-casino operations, which have seen a surge in popularity in recent years.</p>
<p>Under the new order, all online and e-casino operators must register with the government and obtain a license in order to operate. The government will also be granted broad authority to shut down unlicensed operations.</p>
<p>President Duterte has long been critical of illegal gambling, which he has described as a “cancer” that is damaging Filipino society. In his remarks announcing the signing of the new order, he urged all Filipinos to shun illegal gambling and support the country’s legitimate gaming businesses.</p>
<p>The crackdown on online and e-casino operations is likely to have a significant impact on the industry. Many operators have already begun shutting down their services in anticipation of stricter regulations. Some observers fear that this could lead to a slowdown in the growth of the Philippines’ gaming sector, which is currently one of the fastest-growing in Asia.</p>
<h1 id="Philippines-Increases-Efforts-to-Eradicate-Illegal-Gambling"><a href="#Philippines-Increases-Efforts-to-Eradicate-Illegal-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Philippines Increases Efforts to Eradicate Illegal Gambling"></a>Philippines Increases Efforts to Eradicate Illegal Gambling</h1><p>The Philippines government is stepping up its efforts to eradicate illegal gambling in the country.</p>
<p>Justice Secretary Vitaliano Aguirre II recently said that the government will be intensifying its crackdown on illegal gambling, which is estimated to be worth PHP 120 billion (US$2.4 billion) a year.</p>
<p>“Illegal gambling has become a major problem in our society. It not only victimizes the poor and the vulnerable, but it also breeds corruption in our government and law enforcement agencies,” Aguirre said.</p>
<p>In addition to increasing law enforcement efforts, the government is also working to strengthen anti-gambling laws. This includes amending the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office (PCSO) charter to allow it to better regulate and track illegal gambling operations.</p>
<p>The Philippines has been struggling with a rampant illegal gambling problem for many years. In 2015, President Rodrigo Duterte vowed to crack down on all forms of illegal gambling in the country.</p>
<p>However, despite increased law enforcement efforts, the problem persists. This is largely due to the large and powerful illegal gambling syndicates that operate in the country.</p>
<p>These syndicates are often linked to organized crime and terrorism, making it difficult for law enforcement officials to take them down.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the Philippines government remains committed to eradicating illegal gambling and protecting its citizens from the negative effects of this harmful activity.</p>

        <h1 id="Michigan-Online-Gambling-Finally-Begins"><a href="#Michigan-Online-Gambling-Finally-Begins" class="headerlink" title="Michigan Online Gambling Finally Begins!"></a>Michigan Online Gambling Finally Begins!</h1><p>Michigan’s new online gambling laws have finally come into effect, making it the 25th state in the US to legalize some form of internet gambling. The Michigan Gaming Control Board (MGCB) has been busy working on the regulations for months, and on June 1st they were finally released.</p>
<p>The new regulations allow for online poker, casino games, and sports betting, but there are some restrictions. For example, only players over 21 years of age are allowed to gamble, and only licensed casinos in Michigan are allowed to offer online gambling services.</p>
<p>One of the main goals of the new regulations is to protect players from unscrupulous operators. All licensed casinos in Michigan must comply with strict guidelines regarding security and player protection. They must also implement measures to detect and prevent problem gambling.</p>
<p>There has been a lot of excitement in Michigan over the legalization of online gambling. Casino operators are already gearing up to offer their services online, and players are eager to start gambling from the comfort of their own homes. It will be interesting to see how the market develops in Michigan and whether other states follow suit.</p>
<h1 id="Michigan’s-First-Legal-Online-Gambling-Site-Goes-Live"><a href="#Michigan’s-First-Legal-Online-Gambling-Site-Goes-Live" class="headerlink" title="Michigan’s First Legal Online Gambling Site Goes Live"></a>Michigan’s First Legal Online Gambling Site Goes Live</h1><p>Michigan’s first legal online gambling site has gone live, making it the ninth state in the US with some form of regulated internet gambling.</p>
<p>The site, operated by the Michigan Lottery, will offer a range of games including slots, blackjack and poker. Players must be physically located in Michigan to play.</p>
<p>Players must be at least 21 years old and will be able to deposit and withdraw money using a variety of methods.</p>
<p>Michigan is one of several states that have considered legalizing online gambling in recent years. In 2016, a bill to legalize and regulate online poker was approved by the state senate but ultimately failed to pass in the House of Representatives.</p>
<h1 id="Michigan-Gaming-Commission-approves-first-online-gambling-site"><a href="#Michigan-Gaming-Commission-approves-first-online-gambling-site" class="headerlink" title="Michigan Gaming Commission approves first online gambling site"></a>Michigan Gaming Commission approves first online gambling site</h1><p>Michigan’s Gaming Commission has given the green light to the state’s first online gambling site, which will be operated by the Detroit casino.</p>
<p>The new site, which is expected to launch in mid-April, will allow players to gamble on casino games such as blackjack and roulette, as well as bet on sports games.</p>
<p>Players will need to be physically located in Michigan in order to access the site.</p>
<p>Commission chairman Jeff Guilfoyle said that the new site would be a “game changer” for the state’s casino industry, and would help to combat illegal online gambling operations.</p>
<p>Michigan is one of a number of states that are currently preparing for the launch of legal online gambling.</p>
<h1 id="MGM-Grand-to-Launch-First-Online-Casino-in-Michigan"><a href="#MGM-Grand-to-Launch-First-Online-Casino-in-Michigan" class="headerlink" title="MGM Grand to Launch First Online Casino in Michigan"></a>MGM Grand to Launch First Online Casino in Michigan</h1><p>Michigan’s first online casino is set to launch in 2020, MGM Grand has announced. The new site will be available to players in the state, with a selection of slots, table games and other offerings.</p>
<p>MGM Grand has been awarded one of four licenses to operate an online casino in Michigan. The company already operates land-based casinos in Detroit and Flint, and is now looking to capitalize on the growing online gambling market.</p>
<p>Michigan’s online gambling industry is expected to be worth $236 million by 2023, according to research by GlobalData.</p>
<p>“We are excited about our upcoming entry into the Michigan online gaming market,” said Corey Sanders, Chief Operating Officer of MGM Resorts International’s digital division. “Our proven experience in delivering a world-class experience across our resorts will be brought to life in this new product.”</p>
<p>The MGM Grand online casino will offer a range of games, including slots, blackjack and roulette. There will also be a sports betting platform available, along with a loyalty program that rewards players for their play.</p>
<p>Michigan became the 10th U.S. state to legalize online gambling when Governor Gretchen Whitmer signed a bill into law in December 2019. The bill allows for both internet poker and casino games, as well as sports betting.</p>
<h1 id="Borgata-Bringing-its-New-Jersey-On-line-Casino-Games-to-Michigan"><a href="#Borgata-Bringing-its-New-Jersey-On-line-Casino-Games-to-Michigan" class="headerlink" title="Borgata Bringing its New Jersey On-line Casino Games to Michigan"></a>Borgata Bringing its New Jersey On-line Casino Games to Michigan</h1><p>Michigan residents will soon be able to enjoy the popular casino games offered by Borgata Hotel Casino &amp; Spa in Atlantic City. Borgata has announced that it will be offering its online casino games to Michigan residents via the internet and mobile devices starting in early 2019.</p>
<p>Borgata is currently the second-largest land-based casino operator in New Jersey, and it offers a wide range of popular on-line casino games. The company’s entry into the Michigan market is sure to heat up the competition among on-line casinos in that state.</p>
<p>Michigan is one of only a handful of states that currently does not have any legalized on-line gambling. However, state lawmakers have been discussing proposals to legalize on-line gambling for several years, and it is possible that legislation could be enacted in 2019. If such legislation were enacted, Borgata would be well positioned to become a dominant player in the Michigan online casino market.</p>
<p>The announcement by Borgata comes at a time when many other states are also moving to legalize online gambling. In fact, Nevada, Delaware, and New Jersey have all already legalized some form of online gambling, and several other states are considering similar legislation. This trend is likely to continue in 2019 as more and more states seek to tap into the growing potential revenue from online gambling.</p>

The bill was passed in December last year, and allows for both poker and casino games to be played online.</p>
<p>The rollout will be conducted in stages, with the first group of casinos able to offer online gaming from today. These include:</p>
<p>• MGM Grand Detroit</p>
<p>• MotorCity Casino Hotel</p>
<p>• Greektown Casino-Hotel</p>
<p>• Jackpot Party Casino</p>
<p>Additional casinos will be added in the coming weeks and months, with all of Michigan’s tribal casinos likely to offer online gaming by the end of 2019. Players must be physically located within Michigan in order to play, which should come as welcome news to residents of the state.</p>
<p>Online gambling has been legal in Nevada, New Jersey and Delaware since 2013, and Pennsylvania joined them earlier this year. Other states are expected to follow suit in the coming years, as the industry gears up for what is expected to be a multi-billion dollar market.</p>

<p>The site, which is operated by the Michigan Lottery, offers a range of games, including poker, blackjack, and slots.</p>
<p>Players must be 18 or older to participate, and they must reside in Michigan.</p>
<p>The launch of the site has been met with mixed reactions. While some players are excited to have the opportunity to gamble online legally, others are concerned that the site will be a magnet for online gambling addiction.</p>
<p> lottery director Gary Lincoln defended the site, saying that it has several safeguards in place to prevent addiction, including daily betting and loss limits and a self-exclusion feature that allows players to bar themselves from the site.</p>
<p>“We feel confident that our site will offer a safe and enjoyable experience for all of our players,” Lincoln said.</p>
<p>The state of Michigan has been exploring the possibility of legalizing online gambling for several years. In 2016, lawmakers approved a bill that would have allowed casinos to offer online poker and other casino games. However, the bill was vetoed by Governor Rick Snyder.</p>
<p>In 2017, lawmakers approved a new bill that would legalize online gambling but would give control of the industry to the state’s existing casinos instead of allowing new casinos to enter the market. That bill was also vetoed by Governor Snyder.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, lawmakers approved a third bill that would legalize online gambling and give oversight of the industry to the state’s Gaming Control Board. The bill was signed into law by Governor Gretchen Whitmer in April.</p>
