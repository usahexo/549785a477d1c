#  7 Types of Poker Hands Everyone Should Know

There are many possible poker hands, but some are more powerful than others. Here are the seven best types of hands to know as a beginner.

1. Royal Flush

This is the strongest hand in poker, and it’s made up of the five highest cards in the deck: Ace, King, Queen, Jack, and Ten of the same suit. If you are lucky enough to get a royal flush, you can expect to win a lot of money!

2. Straight Flush

A straight flush is five consecutive cards of the same suit. This hand is less powerful than a royal flush but is still very rare and can win a lot of money if played correctly.

3. Four of a Kind

Four of a kind is four cards of the same rank. This hand is very strong and can easily beat most other combinations.

4. Full House

A full house is three cards of one rank and two cards of another rank. This hand can be very powerful, especially if the three matching cards are high ranks.

5. Flush

A flush is five cards of the same suit, but not all consecutive like a straight flush. This hand can be very dangerous if two players have flushes because there is no clear winner.

6. Straight

A straight is five consecutive cards, but not all from the same suit like a straight flush. This hand can easily lose to a four of a kind or full house, so it’s important not to bet too much on it.

#  How to Play the Rarest and Most Powerful Hand in Poker

If you enjoy playing poker, there is a good chance you have heard about the so-called "Big Slick" hand. This is a nickname for an extremely powerful starting hand that features an Ace and a King. In this article, we will discuss how to play the Big Slick in various situations and explain why it is such a coveted hand in poker.

First of all, it is important to understand that the Big Slick can be played in a variety of ways. For instance, you may want to raise preflop with this hand in order to build up the pot; or, alternatively, you may elect to simply call if there are several other players in the hand. After the flop has been dealt, you will need to pay close attention to the situation and decide whether or not to continue betting. If there is a lot of action occurring at the table, it might be wise to fold your Big Slick hand; but if there are only a few players still in contention, then you may want to put more money into the pot.

Of course, one of the main reasons why the Big Slick is so powerful is because it contains two high-value cards. In particular, an Ace and King can often create an unbeatable poker hand. As such, you should always strive to make as much money as possible when holding this hand. Even if you don't end up winning the pot outright, making your opponents fold will still result in some valuable chips heading your way.

In short, if you are fortunate enough to hold Big Slick during a game of poker, remember to play it aggressively and make sure that you extract as much value from your opponents as possible. With a little bit of luck and some shrewd play, you could very well find yourself winning big pots with this powerful hand!
