#  Delaware Gambling Firm Reaps Rewards After Changing Rules

A Delaware gambling firm has seen a surge in business after the state relaxed its rules governing internet gambling.

The firm, which was among the first to offer online gambling in Delaware, saw its profits soar after the change. In the months following the rule change, the company's profits increased by more than 40%.

Delaware's decision to relax its rules was spurred by a report from the state's Gaming Control Board that showed that internet gambling was generating millions of dollars in tax revenue.

The chairman of the Gaming Control Board said that the board had been "encouraged by the strong growth in online gaming" and that it looked forward to "continued success."

The chairman also said that the board was committed to ensuring that online gambling was "conducted in a safe and responsible manner."

Online gambling is currently legal in only three states: Delaware, New Jersey, and Nevada. But experts believe that this number is likely to grow in the years ahead.

#  Delaware Fortune Mouse Firm Rewarded After Making Big Gamble

When Delaware-based Fortune Mouse Firm decided to make a move into the cannabis market, they knew it would be a big gamble. But it turns out that their risk has paid off, as they’ve now been rewarded with a major investment from a leading cannabis firm.

Fortune Mouse made the decision to enter the cannabis industry in early 2018, when cannabis was still federally illegal. This put them in a precarious situation, as they were banking on the fact that cannabis would eventually be legalized on the federal level. And while there was some risk involved, Fortune Mouse had faith that the cannabis market would grow in size and importance.

Fast-forward to 2019, and it’s clear that Fortune Mouse was right about cannabis. The industry is now worth billions of dollars, and is only projected to continue growing in the years ahead. This has led many cannabis firms to invest in other firms, and this is exactly what happened with Fortune Mouse.

In late 2019, Aurora Cannabis, one of the leading cannabis firms in the world, announced an investment into Fortune Mouse. This investment is worth millions of dollars, and will help Fortune Mouse expand their operations significantly. With this new investment, Fortune Mouse will be able to open new dispensaries and cultivation facilities across the United States.

This is a huge victory for Fortune Mouse, as it proves that their gamble on cannabis was well worth it. And while there are still risks involved in the cannabis industry, firms like Fortune Mouse show that there is also tremendous potential for growth. So if you’re looking for an exciting and profitable industry to invest in, look no further than cannabis!
