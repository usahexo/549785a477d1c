#  Easter Bingo at WPT Poker - How to Play to Win

Easter is a time for family, friends, fun - and of course, bingo! If you're looking to add an element of excitement to your Easter celebration, why not try playing Easter bingo? WPT Poker has all the information you need to get started.

First, let's take a look at the basics of how to play Easter bingo. The game is played with a traditional bingo card, which has five rows and five columns. In each row and column are 24 squares, each containing a different Easter-themed image. The aim of the game is to mark off as many squares as possible on your card by calling out the images as they are called out by the caller.

The caller will start by calling out one square at a time. Players then mark this square off on their cards by daubing it with a chip or pen. If a player has the image that has been called out, they can either call out "BINGO!" or just cross it off their card. The first player to completely cover one row on their card (either horizontally, vertically or diagonally) wins the game.

Now that you know how to play Easter bingo, let's take a look at some tips for how to win.

1.amiliarize yourself with the images that are going to be called out. This will help you keep track of which squares you need to mark off on your card.
2. Make sure you have plenty of chips or pens handy so that you can mark off your squares quickly and easily.
3. Stay focused and pay attention to what's being called out - don't get distracted! 
4. Keep track of how many squares you've marked off so far - this will give you an idea of how close you are to winning.
5. If possible, try to position yourself near the caller so that you can hear them clearly and mark off your squares quickly.
6."BINGO!" when you've won - otherwise, someone else might beat you to it!
