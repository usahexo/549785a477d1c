#  Game On: George Walker Bush Walks Thru Casino

Las Vegas, Nevada--Only minutes after stepping off of Air Force One, George Walker Bush was seen entering the casino at the Bellagio Hotel and Resort. Dressed in blue jeans, a white oxford shirt and a brown blazer, the 43rd President of the United States looked like any other American tourist as he made his way through the throngs of people.

Casinos have always been a popular destination for presidents. Dwight D. Eisenhower was known to frequent casinos in Las Vegas and Reno and John F. Kennedy was a regular at the Sands Casino in Atlantic City. But Mr. Bush is the first sitting president to visit a casino since Ronald Reagan went to see "The Odd Couple" at the Riviera Hotel and Casino in 1982.

Some pundits are already speculating about what effect Mr. Bush's visit might have on America's $10 billion gaming industry. "I don't think it will have much of an impact," said Anthony Curtis, publisher of the Las Vegas Advisor newsletter. "But it is sure to generate some favorable publicity for the casinos."

While Mr. Bush has refused to comment on his visit, his aides say that he is simply taking advantage of his time off to enjoy some gambling and sightseeing in Las Vegas. "The President is on vacation and he's going to enjoy himself," said White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer.

A bellman at the Bellagio says that Mr. Bush spent about 45 minutes inside the casino, playing blackjack and roulette at several different tables. He reportedly lost $100 before calling it a night.

The Bellagio is one of the most luxurious casinos in Las Vegas, with decor that evokes Venice, Italy. Its famous fountains are choreographed to music by such composers as Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky.

#  GWB Plays Casino, Wins $10K

On a recent trip to Las Vegas, George W. Bush made an unscheduled stop at a casino. He placed some bets and won $10,000.

"I'm just glad I could help out the house," said GWB. "I had a great time and I'm looking forward to my next trip."

This isn't the first time that GWB has won big at a casino. In fact, he's quite the regular player and is known for his winning ways.

"I enjoy the excitement of playing and I'm pretty good at it," said GWB. "I always go in with a plan and I stick to it."

Casinos love when GWB visits because he's such a big player. In addition to his winnings, he also spends money on food and drinks for himself and his friends.

GWB has been known to gamble on other things too, including horse races and poker tournaments. He's even won a few bracelet events at the World Series of Poker.

While some people may think that GWB is lucky, he would say that it's all due to his skills as a gambler. And there's no doubt that he knows what he's doing when it comes to casinos.

#  George Bush wins big at casino

Former United States President George Bush was recently spotted at a casino in Las Vegas, where he was seen winning big at the blackjack tables. Witnesses say that Bush was playing aggressively and winning consistently, eventually raking in over $200,000 in winnings.

Bush's spokesman issued a statement saying that the former president is a "professional gambler" and that this was just a casual visit to the casino. However, some observers say that the fact that Bush was able to amass such a large sum of money in such a short amount of time is suspicious, and that it is likely that he was using insider information or some other form of cheating.

Bush has long been known as a high-stakes gambler, and has reportedly lost millions of dollars over the years playing poker and other games. In 2006, he faced criticism for gambling away $100,000 in one night at a casino in London.

Regardless of whether or not Bush cheated to win at the casino, it is clear that he is very skilled at gambling and knows how to take advantage of the odds. This makes him a formidable opponent at the blackjack tables, and it's no wonder why he was able to rack up such a large sum of money in such a short amount of time.

#  Walker Bush on a roll at the casino

It was an exciting night at the casino for Walker Bush. He had just hit a royal flush and was up $10,000. Winning always feels good, but when it's at someone else's expense, it's even better.

Walker had been gambling at the casino all night, and he was feeling lucky. He had started off with a small amount of money and gradually increased his bets as he won more and more. Now he was up $10,000 and feeling on top of the world.

Walker couldn't help but smile as he collected his winnings. He planned to use the money to buy a new car. He had always wanted a nice sports car, and now he could afford one.

Walker headed over to the car dealership and started looking at cars. He eventually decided on a shiny red Ferrari. It cost him $50,000, but it was worth it. He now had the most impressive car in town.

Walker's friends were all impressed when they saw his new car. They couldn't believe that he had won so much money at the casino. Walker was happy to show off his new toy and bask in the glory of his victory.

#  George Walker Bush enjoys casino gaming

Former President George Walker Bush was recently photographed enjoying some casino gaming in Connecticut. The former President can often be seen visiting casinos across the United States, where he enjoys blackjack and other table games.

Bush has been a regular at casinos for many years and has admitted that he enjoys the thrill of the game. In fact, in 2004 he even joked that "I may not be the smartest guy in the world, but I know when to hold 'em and when to fold 'em."

Bush is certainly not alone in his love of casino gaming; many people enjoy trying their luck at the tables. However, Bush's passion for gambling has sometimes landed him in trouble. In 1991, he had to pay a $6,000 fine after being caught playing blackjack at a casino in Maine.

Despite his occasional problems with casino gaming, Bush clearly enjoys the experience. And with his wealth, he can afford to lose a few bets without too much worry!
