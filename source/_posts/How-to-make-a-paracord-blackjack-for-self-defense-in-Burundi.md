#  How to make a paracord blackjack for self-defense in Burundi

A blackjack, also known as a cosh, is a blunt weapon made of wood, rubber, or other materials. It is similar to a club, but has a longer handle.

Blacksmiths in Burundi can make a paracord blackjack for self-defense. The blackjack is easy to make and requires only a few materials.

To make a blackjack, you will need:

3 feet of paracord
1 wooden dowel or stick
craft knife
 lighter or heat source

Begin by cutting the paracord into 3 equal pieces. Cutting it into 3 pieces will give you enough to work with and leave enough cord for a handle.
Thread one end of each piece of cord through the hole in the dowel or stick. Pull the cords tight and tie them together in the middle. This will create the handle for your blackjack. 
Take the other ends of the cord and braid them together. Once they are braided together, tie them off with another knot. This will create the striking surface for your blackjack. 
Finally, use a lighter or heat source to seal the ends of the cord. This will prevent them from unraveling over time.

#  How to help defend your community with a paracord blackjack in Burundi

A blackjack, also known as a cosh, is a short, thick piece of metal or wood with a leather strap attached to one end. It is swung by striking an opponent with the other end.

The blackjack is an excellent self-defense tool and can be used to defend yourself or your community in Burundi. It is easy to carry and can be concealed in a pocket or bag.

To use the blackjack, hold it with one hand and strike your opponent with the other end. Aim for the head or face to cause the most damage. Continue striking your opponent until they are incapacitated or flee.

Remember, always use caution when using a blackjack. Do not strike anyone who does not pose a threat to you or your community.

#  Learning how to make a paracord blackjack can save lives in Burundi

Making a blackjack out of paracord is a simple process that can be done in just a few minutes. Paracord is made up of multiple strands that can be used for various purposes, including creating a weapon for self-defense.

A blackjack is a small, handheld weapon that is typically made from wood, but can also be made from other materials such as plastic or metal. It is used as an impact weapon and can deliver powerful blows to an opponent.

When made from paracord, a blackjack becomes even more versatile. Not only does it deliver a powerful strike, but the cord can also be used to restrain an opponent. In a survival situation, this could mean the difference between life and death.

The following steps will show you how to make your own paracord blackjack:

1. Cut a piece of paracord that is about 18 inches long. This will give you plenty of cord to work with.
2. Separate the individual strands of the cord and remove the inner core. This can be done by pulling on each strand until it snaps free from the core.
3. Take one of the severed strands and fold it in half, then twist it around the rest of the cord to form a handle. Do the same thing with the other three strands, then tie them all together at the base of the handle using a basic knot.
4. Trim any excess cord from the handle and youâ€™re ready to use your new blackjack!

#  Paracord Blackjack - easy guide on how to make one for yourself in Burundi 

Looking for an easy project? Why not make your own blackjack using paracord? This guide will show you how!

You'll Need: 
- Paracord (at least 10 feet) 
- Ruler or measuring tape 
- scissors 
- lighter
- optional: beads, charms, or other decorations

1. Cut a piece of paracord that is about 10 feet long. If you want a longer or shorter blackjack, adjust the length accordingly. Remember, you'll also need some extra cord for knotting. 
2. Measure out 1.5 inches from one end of the cord and make a mark. This will be the placement for your first bead or charm. 
3. From the same end, measure out 1/2 inch and make another mark. This is where you will start knotting your paracord. 
4. Heat up your lighter and seal the ends of your cord to prevent fraying. 
5. Take the left side of the cord and bring it over the right side so that it's now in the middle* (see photo A). Now take the right side of the cord and do the same thing (see photo B). 
6. Now hold on to both of those middle sections of cord and pull tight (see photo C). This is called a loop knot, and it's what we'll use to create our blackjack handle. Make sure this knot is nice and tight! 
7. Now let's add our first bead or charm by threading it onto the left side of the cord (see photo D), then bringing it over to the right side (see photo E). Now take the left side of the cord and do the same thing (see photo F), threading it through the hole on the charm or bead. 
8. Once you've added all your beads or charms, it's time to start knotting! Take the right side of the cord and bring it over to the left side (see photo G), then take the left side of the cord and do the same thing (see photo H). Now hold on to both cords and pull tight (see photo I). You've just created your second loop knot! 
9. Keep knotting in this manner until you reach your desired length (I did about 22 knots). Make sure each knot is tight so that your blackjack doesn't unravel! 
10 Finally, cut off any excess cord and seal with a lighter. Your blackjack is now ready for gaming fun!

#  How to make a paracord blackjack for under $10 - perfect for defending yourself in Burundi

In this tutorial, I will be showing you how to make a paracord blackjack for under $10. This is an ideal self defense weapon for traveling to Burundi, as it is easy to conceal and can pack a powerful punch.

To make the blackjack, you will need the following materials:

1. A length of paracord (at least 2 feet long)
2. A small piece of wood or metal (3-4 inches long)
3. A hot glue gun
4. Sandpaper (optional)
5. A ruler or measuring tape

Step 1: Cut the Paracord
The first step is to cut the paracord into two equal lengths. Make sure that the piece of cord is at least 2 feet long, as you will need this for the handle of the blackjack. If you want to add a bit of extra length, you can always trim it down later.

Step 2: Create the Handle Loop
The next step is to create a loop on one end of the cord, which will be used to create the handle of the blackjack. To do this, use a ruler or measuring tape to find the center point of the cord. Then, use a hot glue gun to secure a small piece of wood or metal at this point (3-4 inches long). Make sure that the wood or metal is securely glued in place before moving on to the next step.

Step 3: Wrap The Paracord Around The Handle 
Now, it's time to start wrapping the paracord around the handle. Start by holding one end of the cord against the base of the handle and wrapping it around several times until it is securely fastened in place. You can use a dab of hot glue if needed. Then, do the same thing with the other end of cord, making sure that it forms an even coil around the handle. You may need to trim excess cord once you are finished wrapping if it exceeds 12-inches in length. 
If desired, you can also sand down any rough edges on either side of the handle using some fine-grit sandpaper. Be careful not to scratch or damage the wood/metal handle while doing this.
