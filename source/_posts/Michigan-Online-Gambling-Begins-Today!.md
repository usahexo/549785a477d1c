#  Michigan Online Gambling Begins Today!

Michigan is the latest state to legalize online gambling, with a number of casinos set to offer their services from today. The bill was passed in December last year, and allows for both poker and casino games to be played online.

The rollout will be conducted in stages, with the first group of casinos able to offer online gaming from today. These include:

• MGM Grand Detroit

• MotorCity Casino Hotel

• Greektown Casino-Hotel

• Jackpot Party Casino

Additional casinos will be added in the coming weeks and months, with all of Michigan’s tribal casinos likely to offer online gaming by the end of 2019. Players must be physically located within Michigan in order to play, which should come as welcome news to residents of the state.

Online gambling has been legal in Nevada, New Jersey and Delaware since 2013, and Pennsylvania joined them earlier this year. Other states are expected to follow suit in the coming years, as the industry gears up for what is expected to be a multi-billion dollar market.

#  Michigan's First Legalized Online Gambling Site Goes Live

Michigan's first legalized online gambling site went live earlier this week.

The site, which is operated by the Michigan Lottery, offers a range of games, including poker, blackjack, and slots.

Players must be 18 or older to participate, and they must reside in Michigan.

The launch of the site has been met with mixed reactions. While some players are excited to have the opportunity to gamble online legally, others are concerned that the site will be a magnet for online gambling addiction.

 lottery director Gary Lincoln defended the site, saying that it has several safeguards in place to prevent addiction, including daily betting and loss limits and a self-exclusion feature that allows players to bar themselves from the site.

"We feel confident that our site will offer a safe and enjoyable experience for all of our players," Lincoln said.

The state of Michigan has been exploring the possibility of legalizing online gambling for several years. In 2016, lawmakers approved a bill that would have allowed casinos to offer online poker and other casino games. However, the bill was vetoed by Governor Rick Snyder.

In 2017, lawmakers approved a new bill that would legalize online gambling but would give control of the industry to the state's existing casinos instead of allowing new casinos to enter the market. That bill was also vetoed by Governor Snyder.

Earlier this year, lawmakers approved a third bill that would legalize online gambling and give oversight of the industry to the state's Gaming Control Board. The bill was signed into law by Governor Gretchen Whitmer in April.
