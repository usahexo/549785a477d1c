#  Philippines Clarifies What is Considered Illegal Gambling

In the Philippines, there are many forms of gambling that are considered illegal. However, with the recent clarification from the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation (PAGCOR), it is now known what specifically is illegal gambling within the country.

Illegal gambling in the Philippines generally refers to any form of gambling that is not authorized or regulated by PAGCOR. This includes poker games and other card games, as well as slot machines and other casino games. In addition, sports betting is also considered illegal under Philippine law.

However, there are a few exceptions to this rule. For example, horseracing and bingo are both legal forms of gambling in the Philippines, as they are authorized and regulated by PAGCOR. In addition, scratch tickets and other lottery games are also legal in the Philippines.

So what exactly is illegal under Philippine law? Basically, any form of gambling that is not expressly authorized or regulated by PAGCOR is considered illegal. This includes poker games and other card games, as well as slot machines and other casino games. It also includes sports betting, which is currently the most popular form of gambling in the Philippines.

According to PAGCOR, anyone caught participating in illegal gambling risks being fined or even arrested. So if you’re in the Philippines and you want to gamble, make sure you stick to authorized and regulated activities like horseracing or bingo. Otherwise, you could get into trouble with the law.

#  Philippines Cracks Down on Illegal Gambling Operations

The Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation (PAGCOR) has intensified its crackdown against illegal gambling operations in the country.

Since the start of the year, PAGCOR has conducted several raids against illegal gambling dens, which have resulted in the arrests of dozens of operators and players.

PAGCOR officials have vowed to step up their efforts to rid the country of illegal gambling, which they say is harming both the economy and society.

"Illegal gambling continues to proliferate in many parts of the country due to the inaction or lack of coordination among law enforcement agencies," PAGCOR Chairperson Andrea Domingo said in a statement.

"This not only deprives government of much needed revenues but also fosters crimes such as robbery, extortion, kidnapping and other forms of violence," she added.

Domingo said that PAGCOR would work closely with law enforcement agencies to crack down on illegal gambling operations.

#  Philippines Criminalizes All Forms of Illegal Gambling

On July 17, the Philippines’ lower house of Congress passed House Bill 8811 or the "Anti-Illegal Gambling Act" with a unanimous vote. If enacted into law, the new legislation will criminalize all forms of illegal gambling in the country.

House Speaker Pantaleon Alvarez, a principal sponsor of the bill, said that it is about time that the Philippines has a comprehensive law against illegal gambling. He added that the bill seeks to address not only unlicensed gambling but also other illegal activities like jueteng and masiao.

Alvarez noted that while there are already laws regulating specific types of gambling, there is no law that comprehensively prohibits all forms of illegal gambling. The new measure, he said, will fill this gap.

Under HB 8811, all forms of unlicensed gambling will be punishable by up to six years imprisonment and a fine of 500,000 pesos (US$10,000). In addition, those who operate or manage an illegal gambling establishment will face a jail term of up to 12 years and a fine of 1 million pesos (US$20,000).

The bill also penalizes people who knowingly allow their property to be used for illegal gambling activities with a jail term of up to six years and a fine of 300,000 pesos (US$6,000).

The proposed legislation has been welcomed by anti-gambling advocates who have long been calling for a more comprehensive law against illegal gambling in the Philippines. They say that such a measure is urgently needed to protect Filipino citizens from the negative effects of gambling addiction.

#  Philippines Tightens Laws on Illegal Gambling

In a move to curb illegal gambling in the Philippines, President Rodrigo Duterte has signed a new executive order tightening the rules on gambling. The new order specifically targets online and e-casino operations, which have seen a surge in popularity in recent years.

Under the new order, all online and e-casino operators must register with the government and obtain a license in order to operate. The government will also be granted broad authority to shut down unlicensed operations.

President Duterte has long been critical of illegal gambling, which he has described as a “cancer” that is damaging Filipino society. In his remarks announcing the signing of the new order, he urged all Filipinos to shun illegal gambling and support the country’s legitimate gaming businesses.

The crackdown on online and e-casino operations is likely to have a significant impact on the industry. Many operators have already begun shutting down their services in anticipation of stricter regulations. Some observers fear that this could lead to a slowdown in the growth of the Philippines’ gaming sector, which is currently one of the fastest-growing in Asia.

#  Philippines Increases Efforts to Eradicate Illegal Gambling

The Philippines government is stepping up its efforts to eradicate illegal gambling in the country.

Justice Secretary Vitaliano Aguirre II recently said that the government will be intensifying its crackdown on illegal gambling, which is estimated to be worth PHP 120 billion (US$2.4 billion) a year.

“Illegal gambling has become a major problem in our society. It not only victimizes the poor and the vulnerable, but it also breeds corruption in our government and law enforcement agencies,” Aguirre said.

In addition to increasing law enforcement efforts, the government is also working to strengthen anti-gambling laws. This includes amending the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office (PCSO) charter to allow it to better regulate and track illegal gambling operations.

The Philippines has been struggling with a rampant illegal gambling problem for many years. In 2015, President Rodrigo Duterte vowed to crack down on all forms of illegal gambling in the country.

However, despite increased law enforcement efforts, the problem persists. This is largely due to the large and powerful illegal gambling syndicates that operate in the country.

These syndicates are often linked to organized crime and terrorism, making it difficult for law enforcement officials to take them down.

Nevertheless, the Philippines government remains committed to eradicating illegal gambling and protecting its citizens from the negative effects of this harmful activity.
