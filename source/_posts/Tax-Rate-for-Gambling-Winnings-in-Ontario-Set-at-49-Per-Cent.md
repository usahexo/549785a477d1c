#  Tax Rate for Gambling Winnings in Ontario Set at 49 Per Cent

On July 12th, the Ontario government announced that the tax rate on gambling winnings would be set at 49 per cent. This announcement came as part of the government's annual economic statement, which outlined all of the changes that will be made to Ontario's tax code for the upcoming year.

The new tax rate will apply to all types of gambling winnings, including those won from casino games, slot machines, lottery tickets, and sports bets. It is hoped that this change will help to generate an additional $35 million in revenue for the province each year.

In explaining the decision to increase the gambling tax rate, Minister of Finance Charles Sousa said that it was important to ensure that Ontarians "pay their fair share". He also noted that the government has been working hard to make sure that those who gamble responsibly are not unduly affected by these changes.

Opposition parties were quick to criticize the government's decision, with both the Progressive Conservatives and New Democrats arguing that it would lead to fewer people gambling in Ontario. However, Premier Kathleen Wynne defended the move, stating that it was necessary in order to maintain a balanced budget and fund critical services like healthcare and education.

So far there has been no word on how this change will impact gamers or those who earn a living from betting on sports. It is possible that we could see a decrease in gambling activity in Ontario as a result of this increase in taxation, although it is too early to say for certain.

#  Tax Rate for Gambling Winnings in Alberta Increased to 39 Per Cent

Starting from the new year, the tax rate for gambling winnings in Alberta has been increased from 35 per cent to 39 per cent. The change was announced in the provincial budget released in October and came into effect as of January 1.

The government said that the higher tax rate is necessary to help offset losses stemming from legalized gambling in the province. "Alberta is facing significant deficits due, in part, to our expanded gambling sector," Finance Minister Joe Ceci said when he tabled the budget. "This increase to the tax on gambling winnings will help offset some of these costs."

Opposition parties have criticized the government for introducing the increase, saying it will only hurt people who are already struggling. "This is a direct attack on low- and middle-income earners," United Conservative Party shadow finance minister Drew Barnes said. "It's essentially a tax on poor people."

The new tax rate applies to all forms of gambling, including casino games, lotteries, and sports betting. It is expected to bring in an additional $11 million in revenue for the government each year.

#  Manitoba Announces New Tax Rate for Gambling Winnings 

The Manitoba government has announced a new tax rate for gambling winnings. The new rate is 25 percent, which is 5 percentage points higher than the old rate.

The change was made in order to help close the province's budget deficit. In a statement, Premier Brian Pallister said that the new tax rate will "help ensure that our province continues to be a place where people want to invest and do business."

The increase in the tax rate has been met with criticism from some members of the public. Some argue that it will discourage people from gambling in Manitoba, which could lead to lost revenue for the province.

Others argue that the increased tax rate is fair, given that gambling is a voluntary activity and those who win money should be responsible for paying taxes on their winnings. They also point out that other provinces have similar tax rates for gambling winnings.

#  Quebec Sets Tax Rate for Gambling Winnings at 33 Per Cent 

Quebec has decided to levy a 33 per cent tax on gambling winnings, Minister of Finance Carlos Leitao announced in the province’s budget Thursday.

The new tax rate is expected to bring in $100 million in revenue annually. 

It will apply to all forms of gambling, including casino games, lotteries, and sports betting. 

Gambling winnings are currently subject to federal and provincial taxes, with rates ranging from 26.5 to 29 per cent. 

The government said the move will make Quebec’s tax system more comparable to those of other provinces. 
It also said the added revenue will help it meet its fiscal targets for 2018-2019.

#  New Brunswick Announces Decrease in Tax Rate for Gambling Winnings

The government of New Brunswick has announced a decrease in the tax rate for gambling winnings. The new rate will be 15%, down from the previous rate of 20%.

The change is set to take effect on January 1, 2019. It is hoped that the lower tax rate will help to attract more people to gamble in New Brunswick.

In a statement, Finance Minister Ernie Steeves said, "We are pleased to announce this decrease in the tax rate for gambling winnings. This change will make our province more competitive with other jurisdictions and should result in increased gambling activity in New Brunswick."

Opposition parties have criticised the decision, arguing that it will cost the province money in lost revenue. However, the government insists that the reduction will ultimately lead to increased economic activity and job creation.
