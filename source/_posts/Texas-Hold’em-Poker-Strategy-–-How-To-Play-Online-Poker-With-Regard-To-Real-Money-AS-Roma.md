#  Texas Hold’em Poker Strategy – How To Play Online Poker With Regard To Real Money AS Roma

There is no doubt that Texas Hold’em Poker has become the most popular poker game in the world. Nearly every casino offers some sort of Texas Hold’em, and the game can be found at just about every online casino as well. If you are looking to up your poker game, there is no better place to start than with Texas Hold’em.

Texas Hold’em is a community card game where each player is dealt two private cards, and then five community cards are placed face-up in the middle of the table. The object of the game is to make the best five-card hand using any combination of your two private cards and the five community cards. The first player to act is the player sitting on the left of the dealer, and each player must either bet, call, raise or fold as the action moves around the table.

When playing Texas Hold’em for real money, it’s important to understand a few basic concepts:

1) The Pot – The pot is what all of the players are fighting for. The pot consists of all of the bets that have been made during the hand plus any associated rake.

2) Blinds – The blinds are forced bets that are put in by the two players sitting directly to the left of the dealer button. The small blind is half of what the big blind is, and these bets rotate around the table as each new hand starts.

3) Button – The button is a pointer that moves clockwise around the table after each hand, designating who will be dealing next.

4) Preflop Play – This refers to how you should play your hands before any of the community cards are revealed. You should use your two private cards and whatever information you can gather from seeing what everyone else has put in (the amount of money in front of them).

5) Flop – This is when three community cards are revealed simultaneously. At this point in the hand, you have a better idea of what types of hands opponents might have, so you can start making more calculated decisions about how to play your hand.

6) Turn – This is when another community card is revealed, making four total in play. By now you should have a good idea what kind of hand your opponent(s) might have, and it’s time to start bluffing if necessary.

7) River – This is when the final community card is revealed, making five total in play. This is often when players showdown their hands and determine who wins/loses money.
