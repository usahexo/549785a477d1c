#  Totally Puzzled Port Machine Found in Auburn WA!

In a small town in Washington, an antique machine was discovered in an old barn. This unusual machine has been puzzling locals for years, as no one seems to know what it is or does.

The machine is made of cast iron and has a crank handle on one side. There are a number of rotating discs with strange symbols on them, and a large glass lens in the center. It is estimated that the machine is at least 100 years old.

Some people believe that it is a type of puzzle box, while others think it might be a forerunner to the modern computer. However, no one has been able to figure out how it works or what its purpose might be.

Recently, however, the local high school science club took on the challenge of figuring out this enigmatic machine. They were able to get it working after some trial and error, and discovered that it is actually a type of projector.

The symbols on the discs are coordinates for stars, and the lens projects images of those stars onto a screen. The students were even able to make modifications to the machine so that it could project different images depending on the disc used.

This unusual projector provides a unique glimpse into our past, and offers a new way for people to explore the stars. It's also just plain cool!
