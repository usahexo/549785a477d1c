#  How did the company develop?

The company was founded in 1934 by Armand Hammer. He initially created it as a way to smuggle alcohol into the United States during prohibition. However, he soon pivoted to oil after finding out that there was more money to be made in the oil industry.

The company grew rapidly and became one of the largest oil companies in the world. It also became known for its ruthless business practices, which often involved bribing government officials and cutting corners on safety.

# What are some of the company's most famous products?

Some of the company's most famous products include Occidental Petroleum, OxyContin, and Dr. Pepper.

Occidental Petroleum is a leading oil producer that operates in 17 countries. OxyContin is a prescription painkiller that has been linked to thousands of deaths from addiction. And Dr. Pepper is a popular soft drink that was first created in 1885.

#  What are the major shareholder companies?

The United States, China and Japan are the largest shareholders of the world with a combined ownership of more than 50% of all stocks outstanding. Each country has a somewhat different profile when it comes to what types of companies they own.

The United States is the most diverse when it comes to shareholder companies. They have large stakes in every major category including technology, finance, healthcare, and industrials. While they do have some exposure to consumer discretionary and staples companies, they are not as heavily weighted in these sectors as other countries.

China is the most concentrated shareholder country. More than 70% of their stock holdings are in technology and financial companies. This is largely due to the large number of state-owned enterprises that are publicly traded.

Japan's portfolio is heavily weighted towards industrials and healthcare companies. They have minimal exposure to technology and financial firms. This is likely a result of their demographics; as the population ages, they are likely looking for companies that will benefit from this trend.

#  What are the company's strengths?

There are several things that set a company apart and make it strong. It could be its unique product or the way it is run. Whatever the reason, these strengths should be acknowledged and marketed to potential customers.

Some common strengths include quality products or services, a well-known brand name, a good reputation, innovative products or services, and customer satisfaction. A company can also have strengths in terms of the way it is run, such as having a good management team, being well organized, or being efficient.

When a company knows what its strengths are, it can focus on promoting them to potential customers. This can help attract new business and increase market share. It can also help keep current customers loyal to the company.

If you're looking for ways to improve your business, start by identifying your company's strengths and putting together a marketing strategy around them.

#  What challenges does Sweetspot face?

Sweetspot, a London-based startup that operates an online platform for booking sports facilities, is facing multiple challenges as it seeks to grow its business.

One challenge is that the company has been slow to sign up large partnerships with sports leagues and organizations. These partnerships are essential to driving traffic and usage of the Sweetspot platform.

Another challenge is that the company has struggled to differentiate its product from those of larger competitors such as Sport England and Booking.com. This has made it difficult for Sweetspot to attract users and sign up new partners.

Finally, Sweetspot faces significant competition from other online platforms that offer similar services. This has led to a lower than expected uptake of the company's platform.

The challenges faced by Sweetspot underscore the difficulties of starting and growing a new business in a highly competitive market. The company must find a way to overcome these obstacles if it is to achieve long-term success.
