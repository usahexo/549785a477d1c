The object of the game is to remove all of the blocks from the board by selecting adjacent blocks that are of the same color. The more blocks you remove at one time, the more points you score.

The game is played on a 9x9 board, and there are six different types of blocks. The blue blocks are worth one point each, the green blocks are worth two points each, the red blocks are worth three points each, and the yellow blocks are worth four points each.
